# WHO AM I?

FreeCodeCamp API Exercise: Who Am I

Made by Clojure! :D

## Installation

I compiled the last version as whoami.jar and it's already prepared to run the server.

If you want to compile, just run the below command:
 
    $ lein uberjar

## Usage

You can run using the below command:

    $ java -jar whoami.jar
    
The default port is 8080, if you want to use other port just set the env. variable PORT.
